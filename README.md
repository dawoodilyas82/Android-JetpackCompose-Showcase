# Android-JetpackCompose-Showcase

A personal showcase of my Android development expertise using Jetpack Compose. This project highlights my approach to building scalable, maintainable, and high-quality Android applications, leveraging the latest best practices in Android development.

## About This Project
This repository demonstrates my skills in:
- Crafting intuitive and modern UI using **Jetpack Compose**.
- Implementing **Clean Architecture** for maintainable and scalable projects.
- Adopting the **MVVM pattern** for organized state management.
- Writing **efficient and testable Kotlin code**.
- Utilizing **dependency injection** with **Hilt**.
- Creating **asynchronous programming solutions** with **Coroutines and Flow**.
- **Unit and UI testing** to ensure reliability and stability.

## Key Features
- **Jetpack Compose**: Developed various UI components using the latest UI toolkit for Android, focusing on flexibility and responsiveness.
- **Clean Architecture**: Designed to separate concerns, ensuring each layer is decoupled for better testability and maintainability.
- **MVVM**: Implemented the MVVM design pattern to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Hilt for Dependency Injection**: Simplified dependency management across the app, making code easier to read and test.
- **Navigation Component**: Used Jetpack's Navigation Component to manage in-app navigation seamlessly.
- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: Efficient handling of background tasks and UI updates using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Implemented both unit and UI tests to validate business logic and user interface functionality.

## Project Structure
- `app/` - Main app module, containing Compose-based UI implementations and business logic.
- `core/` - Core utility functions, extensions, and shared resources.
- `data/` - Repository pattern for managing data sources (both local and remote).
- `ui/` - Compose screens and UI-related components, structured for easy readability and customization.
- `test/` - Unit tests and UI tests written to ensure high-quality and bug-free code.

## Getting Started
